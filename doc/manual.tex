\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

You are reading the manual of \href{http://unison-code.github.io/}{Unison}: a
simple, flexible, and potentially optimal open-source tool that performs
integrated \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation}{register
  allocation} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_scheduling}{instruction
  scheduling} using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming}{constraint
  programming}.

Unison can be used as an alternative or as a complement to the algorithms
applied by standard compilers such as \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{GCC} and
\href{http://llvm.org/}{LLVM}.
%
Unison is particularly easy to integrate with the latter as a driver is already
available (see Chapter~\ref{sec:llvm-integration} for details).

This manual is divided into two main parts: Part~\ref{part:using-unison}
(Chapters~\ref{sec:license-contact-and-acknowledgments}
to~\ref{sec:llvm-integration}) is devoted to the use of Unison, while
Part~\ref{part:developing-and-extending-unison} (Chapters~\ref{sec:architecture}
to~\ref{sec:target-description}) deals with its development and extension.

Chapter~\ref{sec:license-contact-and-acknowledgments} discusses licensing
aspects and provides contact information.
%
Chapter~\ref{sec:getting-started} contains instructions to download, build,
install, and test Unison.
%
Chapter~\ref{sec:llvm-integration} describes how to use the LLVM driver.

Chapter~\ref{sec:architecture} outlines the architecture of Unison.
%
Chapter~\ref{sec:unison-ir} describes the intermediate representation
(\emph{Unison IR}).
%
Chapter~\ref{sec:constraint-model} formulates the constraint model that lies at
the core of the Unison approach.
%
Chapter~\ref{sec:target-description} provides information about how processors
are described in Unison.

Appendix~\ref{sec:further-reading} provides references for further reading and
other sources of documentation.

\chapter{Getting Started}%
\label{sec:getting-started}

Unison has to be built from source as we do not yet provide precompiled
packages.
%
The tool is known to work on Linux and it might work on other platforms such as
macOS and Windows as all software dependencies claim to be portable across
these.

Building, installing, and testing Unison in Linux is relatively straightforward.
%
Just take the following steps.

\section{Downloading}

Unison is hosted by \href{https://github.com/unison-code/unison}{GitHub}.
%
The easiest way to access its source code (including the history) is by running:
%
\begin{command}
git clone git@github.com:unison-code/unison.git
\end{command}

\section{Prerequisites}

Unison has the following direct dependencies:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/}{Haskell platform}
\item \href{https://www.qt.io/}{Qt (version 4.x)}
\item \href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{Graphviz library}
\item \href{http://www.gecode.org/}{Gecode (version 5.x)}
\end{itemize}
%
To get the first three dependencies in Debian-based distributions, just run:
%
\begin{command}
apt-get install haskell-platform libqt4-dev libgraphviz-dev
\end{command}

The required version of Gecode can be downloaded from its
\href{http://www.gecode.org/download.html}{website}.

\section{Building}

Just go to the \code{src} directory and run:
%
\begin{command}
make build
\end{command}

\section{Testing}

Unison contains a test suite with a few functions where different targets and
optimization goals are exercised.
%
To execute the tests just run:
%
\begin{command}
make test
\end{command}

\section{Installing}

The building process generates three binaries.
%
The installation process consists in copying the binaries into the appropriate
system directory.
%
To install the binaries under the default directory \code{usr/local} just run:
%
\begin{command}
make install
\end{command}

The installation directory is specified by the Makefile variable \code{PREFIX}.
%
To install the binaries under an alternative directory \code{\$DIR} just run:
%
\begin{command}
make install PREFIX=$DIR
\end{command}

\section{Running}
%
This manual uses the iterative version of the factorial function as a running
example.
%
A possible C implementation is as follows:
%
\fvset{fontsize=\small}
\begin{codeBox}
\BVerbatimInput{code/factorial.c}
\end{codeBox}


When used as a standalone tool, Unison takes as input a function in LLVM's
\href{http://llvm.org/docs/MIRLangRef.html}{Machine IR format (MIR)}.
%
In this format, instructions of a certain processor have already been selected.
%
The factorial function in MIR format with
\href{https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/hexagon-dsp-sdk/dsp-processor}{Hexagon
  V4} instructions looks as follows:
%
\fvset{fontsize=\small}
\begin{codeBox}
\BVerbatimInput{code/factorial.mir}
\end{codeBox}
%
To execute Unison on this function and obtain the optimal register allocation
and instruction schedule for Hexagon V4, just run the following command from the
top of the Git repository:
%
\begin{command}
uni run doc/code/factorial.mir --goal=speed
\end{command}

This command outputs a function in MIR format where registers are allocated and
instructions are scheduled.
%
The function is thus already very close to assembly code:
%
\fvset{fontsize=\small}
\begin{codeBox}
\BVerbatimInput{code/factorial.unison.mir}
\end{codeBox}

The \code{uni} tool has several options and commands such as \code{run}.
%
Detailed information about each option and command can be obtained by running:
%
\begin{command}
uni --help
\end{command}

Unison can be used as a standalone tool as illustrated above but is only really
useful as a complement to a full-fledged compiler.
%
The next section gives instructions to use Unison together with LLVM.

\chapter{LLVM Integration}%
\label{sec:llvm-integration}

Unison is accompanied with a driver that allows transparent integration with the
LLVM compiler infrastructure.
%
In particular, the driver enables
\href{http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html}{LLVM's code generator}
(\code{llc}) to run Unison transparently instead of its standard register
allocation and instruction scheduling algorithms.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:llvm} shows how the LLVM driver interfaces with Unison to
produce assembly code all the way from source code.
%
Arcs between components are labeled with the file extension corresponding to the
shared data file.
%
Unison uses LLVM's \href{http://llvm.org/docs/MIRLangRef.html}{Machine IR format
  (MIR)} as the interface language.
%
Unison takes as input a function in MIR format (\code{.mir}) and the function
where LLVM has already performed register allocation and instruction scheduling
(\code{.asm.mir}) as a starting point for the optimization algorithm.
%
The result of running Unison (\code{.unison.mir}) is sent back to \code{llc}
where the final assembly code is emitted.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \scalebox{0.75}{\input{figures/llvm}}
  \caption{design of the LLVM driver}
  \label{fig:llvm}
\end{figure}

As for the core Unison tool, the driver must be built from source as we do not
yet provide precompiled packages.
%
The driver is known to work on Linux and should work in all other main platforms
provided that Unison itself can be built successfully.

\section{Downloading}

The Unison driver for LLVM is hosted as a LLVM form by
\href{https://github.com/unison-code/llvm}{GitHub}.
%
The easiest way to access its source code (including the history) is by running:
%
\begin{command}
git clone git@github.com:unison-code/llvm.git
\end{command}

LLVM 3.8 is the latest LLVM supported version.
%
To access the driver for this version run the following command on the cloned
repository:
%
\begin{command}
git checkout release_38-unison
\end{command}

\section{Prerequisites}

The LLVM driver depends on Unison being installed successfully.
%
Check the \href{http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements}{LLVM
  website} for the prerequisites to build LLVM itself.

\section{Building, Testing, and Installing}

Just follow the instructions provided at
\href{http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#compiling-the-llvm-suite-source-code}{LLVM's
  website} as usual.

\section{Running with llc}

To execute \code{llc} such that Unison is used for register allocation and
instruction scheduling, just run the following command from the top of the core
Unison Git repository:
%
\begin{command}
llc doc/code/factorial.ll -march=hexagon -mcpu=hexagonv4 -unison
\end{command}

Currently, Unison supports the following LLVM targets (defined by
\code{march}-\code{mcpu}-\code{mattr} triples):

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
    target & \code{-march=} & \code{-mcpu=} & \code{-mattr=} \\\hline
    Hexagon V4 & \code{hexagon} & \code{hexagonv4} & \\
    ARM1156T2F-S & \code{arm} & \code{arm1156t2f-s} & \code{+thumb-mode} \\
    MIPS32 & \code{mips} & \code{mips32} & \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Other flags (with a \code{-unison} prefix) can be used to control the execution
of Unison, run \code{llc --help} for details.

\section{Running with clang}

To execute \code{clang} with Unison's register allocation and instruction
scheduling for Hexagon V4, first build and install a matching \code{clang}
version (see the \href{http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html}{Clang website}
for details).
%
Then just run the following command from the top of the core Unison Git
repository:
%
\begin{command}
clang doc/code/factorial.c -target hexagon -mllvm -unison
\end{command}

Alternatively, functions can be annotated with the \code{"unison"} attribute to
indicate that Unison should be run on them:
%
\begin{command}
__attribute__((annotate("unison")))
\end{command}

\part{Developing and Extending Unison}
\label{part:developing-and-extending-unison}

\chapter{Architecture}%
\label{sec:architecture}

As usual in compiler construction, Unison is organized as a chain of
transformation components through which the program flows.
%
Each intermediate representation of the program is stored in a file.

Figure~\ref{fig:components} shows the main components involved in compilation of
intermediate code to assembly code.
%
Arcs between components are labeled with the file extension corresponding to the
shared data file.
%
The Unison components are enclosed by a dashed rectangle.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \scalebox{0.65}{\input{figures/unison-components}}
  \caption{main components and boundaries of Unison}
  \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

The function of each component is:

\begin{description}

\item [\code{uni import}:] transform the instruction-selected program into
  Unison IR;

\item [\code{uni linearize}:] transform the program to Linear Static Single
  Assignment form;

\item [\code{uni extend}:] extend the program with copies;

\item [\code{uni augment}:] augment the program with alternative temporaries;

\item [\code{uni model}:] formulate a combinatorial problem combining global
  register allocation and instruction scheduling;

\item [\code{gecode-presolver}:] produce an equivalent combinatorial problem
  that is easier to solve;

\item [\code{gecode-solver}:] solve the combinatorial problem;

\item [\code{uni export}:] generate the assembly program with the solution to
  the combinatorial problem.

\section{Objective}

The objective is to minimize the sum of the weighted costs of each block:
%
\genericObjectiveEquation
%
where $\blockWeight{b}$ and $\blockCost{b}$ give the weight and estimated cost
of block $b$.
%
To optimize for speed, $\blockWeight{b}$ is set to $\blockFrequency{b}$
(corresponding to $\optimizeDynamic{} = \code{true}$), and $\blockCost{b}$ is
defined as $\max_{o \in \operations{b} \suchThat
  \activeOperation{o}}{\operationIssueCycle{o}}$ (or simply as
$\operationIssueCycle{\operator{out}(b)}$ where $\operator{out}(b)$ is the
out-delimiter of block $b$).
%
To optimize for code size, $\blockWeight{b}$ is disregarded (corresponding to
$\optimizeDynamic{} = \code{false}$) and $\blockCost{b}$ is defined as $\sum_{o
  \in \operations{b}}{\units{\operationInstruction{o}}{\bits{}}}$, where the
processor resource $\bits{}$ represents the bits with which instructions are
encoded (the particular resource to be optimized for is determined by the
parameter $\optimizeResource{}$).
